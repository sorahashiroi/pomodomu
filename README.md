## 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅 About
`pomodomu` is a simple command-line Pomodoro timer designed to boost your productivity! 🚀
Based on the Pomodoro Technique, it helps you focus by breaking work into 25-minute sessions 🍅, followed by short breaks 🧘‍♀️.
After four Pomodoros, it encourages a longer break to keep you refreshed and prevent burnout 🌱.

The name `pomodomu` combines "Pomodoro" (the Italian word for "tomato", 🍅 which inspired the Pomodoro Technique) and "Domu" 🦾, referencing the iconic Dom mobile suit from the Gundam series! 💥
Just like the Dom, a powerful and efficient machine, `pomodomu` helps you efficiently manage your work and break cycles 💪.
